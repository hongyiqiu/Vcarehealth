Companion plugin for 2017 Theme Integration with Layouts Plugin.

== Description ==

The Layout plugin is intended to easily integrate drag and drop functionalities into your Bootstrap based theme. Layouts can be created with an advanced and complete layout editor.

The Layout plugin sits on a flexible and powerful API which lets you create your custom cell components, in a way very similar to the one you are familiar when you create post types and their meta boxes, and integrate them in the Layout editor and in your theme design.

As a theme author, a developer or an advanced Wordpress user you will be able to customise the layout and content you render with the plugin to the point that 80% of editing work, can be done with the Layout editor.

1. Upload 'layouts-twenty-seventeen' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. 2017 theme and Layouts plugin must be installed and activated before hand.
